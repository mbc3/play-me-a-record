## About

Plays a random record with Music Player Daemon.

I developed this project to learn Python and solve the problem of never knowing what record to play.

This uses a TOML config file to store the minimal settings.

There's almost no way this is optimized - this project was more of a learning experience than anything.

## Installation

```console
pip install play-me-a-record
```
